## What do I do with a .deb file?

Files with a .deb extension are used to install a **package** on a Debian-based system (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.). In this context, **package** is often used interchangeably with the term **program** or **application**.

To install the package via the command-line, replace `DEB_NAME` with the name of your .deb file in the following command: 
`sudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE`
